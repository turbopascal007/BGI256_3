V2.04 Fixes from earlier versions:

BitMapped text was being drawn one pixel down from the proper position.
This was fixed in V2.04.


V2.06 of BGI256 fixes the following problems from earlier versions:

In VesaBank routine, the push/pop was out of sequence. This didn't 
cause any problems, but was fixed anyway to be proper.

ET4000 cards: The ET4000 uses seperate read and write windows in
its super VGA modes. This caused screen reads to be incorrect.
This version now updates both windows.

Diamond Stealth: The Stealth card uses non-sequencial memory in 
800x600x256. This caused garbage to be shown in that mode.
This version manages the problem by obtaining the true scan line 
length from the appropriate VESA description field. 


Known remaining bugs: The FloodFill has a problem when dealing 
with complex fills. I recommend using PolyFill on anything complex,
or use your own floodfill. I haven't had the chance to sitdown and 
take the couple days to figure out how the floodfill works again 
So that I can try to fix it. (Yes I wrote it, but its been ages...). 


New additions: You can now select the background color in Pixel 
draw mode. This was done to allow the circles and arcs to have 
controlable lines like rectangles. This is required because the 
circles and arcs are drawn by the graph unit using PutPixel, so the
BGI has no control over the lines as it does with rectangles.

A seperate Trident driver include file writen by Erik Olbrys
has been included in this package with the permission of Erik
for those who want a specific driver for the Trident card.


V3.00 release:

Provides protected mode support for V7.0 of Borland Pascal. 

Floodfill has finally been properly fixed. 
Full fill write mode support for floodfills has been provided. 
Floodfill supports both border fill and seed fill. 
Floodfill supports both simplex fills and complexx fills. 

Minor changes made in SetWriteMode commands. PutImage write 
mode selections will not be supported in the future since they 
didn't do anything anyway. PutImage Write mode is controlled 
by the PutImage routine. PutImage background color is still 
controlled by SetWriteMode, but the function is being moved
to the new Misc Command selection group. The Get Current 
graphics mode command was also moved to the Misc command 
selection group. It is still currently supported as 
function #25, but this will go away in the future.

Several new functions were added to the SetWriteMode 
function to support the floodfill command.
