To create a BGI driver using the supplied source code you will 
need the following programs:

TASM.EXE     - Borland Turbo Assembler
TLINK.EXE    - Borland Linker
BINOBJ.EXE   - Borland BIN to OBJ converter (for Pascal)
BGIOBJ.EXE   - Borland BGI to OBJ converter (for C, C++)
BDH3.EXE     - Knight Software BGI header builder (V3.0)
CREATE.BAT   - Batch file to create the BGI driver
COPYRITE.DAT - Optional copyright message

TASM and TLINK are provided with the Borland Professional 
language package (C or Pascal). BINOBJ is provided with Turbo 
Pascal. You only need the BGIOBJ program if you are creating an 
OBJ file to be linked into Turbo Pascal at compile time. BGIOBJ 
is provided with Borland's C language. You only need the BGIOBJ 
if you are creating an OBJ file to be linked into C programs. 

BDH3.EXE is provided with this package. The Pascal source 
BDH3.PAS is also provided. The BDH3 program attaches the required 
header information to a previously assembled BGI driver body.

The CREATE.BAT batch file uses the above mentioned files to 
create the BGI driver and OBJ files. In addition to the indicated 
files you will also need the assembler source for the BGI driver. 
An assumption has been made that all files will start with the 
same name. That way you can create the BGI files by calling 
"CREATE NAME". As an example, to create the BGI256 driver, you 
would enter "CREATE BGI256". If you wish to use different names 
for some of the files, then you will have to modify the 
CREATE.BAT file to reflect the changes, or call the individual 
programs in the CREATE.BAT file directly. 

If you are creating a Version 2.00 driver, you will see an error 
message indicating that the code is version 2.00 code and that 
the BDH program is creating the 2.00 driver. If you wish to avoid 
the error message, you can add a "2" to the command line to force 
the BDH3 program into Version 2.00 mode. "CREATE BGI256 2" 
This presumes that the BGI driver was created as version 2.00 
code. You must change the assembler switch in BGI256.ASM to 
select the proper version before calling the CREATE.BAT program.
The BDH3 program detects which version the code is for and 
automatically generates the appropriate BGI driver.

Note that if you are generating C linkable OBJ files, then you 
will have to limit the file name to six characters if you use the 
current CREATE.BAT file mechanism. If you wish to use the full 
eight characters available for the filename, then you will need 
to modify the CREATE.BAT file to adjust the names for for C 
linkable OBJ file names which is the reason for the limitation.
If you are not generating the C linkable OBJ files you can use 
the full eight character filename. 

The BDH3 program requires a binary image of the assembled source 
which is generated by the TASM and TLINK programs. The BDH3 
program also requires the COPYRITE.DAT file which contains the 
copyright message that will be attached to the start of the BGI 
driver. If the COPYRITE.DAT file is not found, the default Knight 
Software copyright message will be used.
